Hello Sir,

The task has been completed, However I was only able to get the accuracy of about
20%. Which was then improved to around 37% when I tried Handpicking some images
from each class from the oroginal dataset provided to me,as the original data set was
too generalize. However, I was only able to get around 55 images for each class 
which was very small amount of images. I was going to try data augumentation but I
ran out of time.


About the environment:

Scripts-
	We can test the model, by running the "Test_T-shirt.py"
	script. simply change the name of the image we wish to check as "test_image.jpg",
	and save it in the same directory as the script. The "Test_T-shirt.py", will simply
	display in the terminal the final class it has classified the image into.




Training Data-

		The trainig data is always present inside the data_sleves directory.
	It has subdirectories of each class. The initial training data contains my Handpicked images
	and it has around 55 images from each class.

	The original dataset given to me can be extracted from the "data_sleeve.rar", and my
	handpicked images are in "hand_pick_data_sleeve" directory.
